	abstract = {Rooted in dynamic systems theory, convergent cross mapping (CCM) has attracted increased attention recently due to its capability in detecting linear and nonlinear causal coupling in both random and deterministic settings. One limitation with CCM is that it uses both past and future values to predict the current value, which is inconsistent with the widely accepted definition of causality, where it is assumed that the future values of one process cannot influence the past of another. To overcome this obstacle, in our previous research, we introduced the concept of causalized convergent cross mapping (cCCM), where future values are no longer used to predict the current value. In this paper, we focus on the implementation of cCCM in causality analysis. More specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of cCCM in identifying both linear and nonlinear causal coupling in various settings through a large number of examples, including Gaussian random variables with additive noise, sinusoidal waveforms, autoregressive models, stochastic processes with a dominant spectral component embedded in noise, deterministic chaotic maps, and systems with memory, as well as experimental fMRI data. In particular, we analyze the impact of shadow manifold construction on the performance of cCCM and provide detailed guidelines on how to configure the key parameters of cCCM in different applications. Overall, our analysis indicates that cCCM is a promising and easy-to-implement tool for causality analysis in a wide spectrum of applications.},

            Convergent cross-mapping (CCM) has attracted increased attention recently due to its capability to detect causality in nonseparable systems under deterministic settings, which may not be covered by the traditional Granger causality. From an information-theoretic perspective, causality is often characterized as the directed information (DI) flowing from one side to the other. As information is essentially nondeterministic, a natural question is: does CCM measure DI flow? Here, we first causalize CCM so that it aligns with the presumption in causality analysis—the future values of one process cannot influence the past of the other, and then establish and validate the approximate equivalence of causalized CCM (cCCM) and DI under Gaussian variables through both theoretical derivations and fMRI-based brain network causality analysis. Our simulation result indicates that, in general, cCCM tends to be more robust than DI in causality detection. The underlying argument is that DI relies heavily on probability estimation, which is sensitive to data size as well as digitization procedures; cCCM, on the other hand, gets around this problem through geometric cross-mapping between the manifolds involved. Overall, our analysis demonstrates that cross-mapping provides an alternative way to evaluate DI and is potentially an effective technique for identifying both linear and nonlinear causal coupling in brain neural networks and other settings, either random or deterministic, or both.},

                  Inferring ecological interactions is hard because we often lack suitable parametric representations to portray them. Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) provide a way of estimating interactions non‐parametrically from time‐series data. NODEs, however, are slow to fit, and inferred interactions usually are not compared with the ground truth.
                
                
                  We provide a fast NODE fitting method, Bayesian neural gradient matching (BNGM), which relies on interpolating time series with neural networks and fitting NODEs to the interpolated dynamics with Bayesian regularisation. We test the accuracy of the approach by inferring ecological interactions in time series generated by an ODE model with known interactions. We compare these results against three existing approaches for estimating ecological interactions, standard NODEs, ODE models and convergent cross‐mapping (CCM). We also infer interactions in experimentally replicated time series of a microcosm featuring an algae, flagellate and rotifer population, in the hare and lynx system, and the Maizuru Bay community featuring 11 species.
                
                
                  Our BNGM approach allows us to reduce the fitting time of NODE systems to only a few seconds and provides accurate estimates of ecological interactions in the artificial system, as true ecological interactions are recovered with minimal error. Our benchmark analysis reveals that our approach is both faster and more accurate than standard NODEs and parametric ODEs, while CCM was found to be faster but less accurate. The analysis of the replicated time series reveals that only the strongest interactions are consistent across replicates, while the analysis of the Maizuru community shows the strong negative impact of the chameleon goby on most species of the community, and a potential indirect negative effect of temperature by favouring goby population growth.
                
                
                  Overall, NODEs alleviate the need for a mechanistic understanding of interactions, and BNGM alleviates the heavy computational cost. This is a crucial step availing quick NODE fitting to larger systems, cross‐validation and uncertainty quantification, as well as more objective estimation of interactions, and complex context dependence, than parametric models.},
